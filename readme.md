## General file(s):

* readme.md  - this file
* readme.txt - the same, but as plain text

## Script files:

For every script there are two distinct files in the repository.
Assume the script itself is named foo.sh, then the associated files
are as follows:

* foo.sh          - This is the actual script, the file you are looking for.

* version-foo.txt - A file containing the version information about the latest version of foo.sh. You won't need this, it's just here to provide information for the update script. (See information below.)


Currently three basic scripts are available in the repository:

*  crusher.sh - A utility script to ease use of pngcrush for multiple PNG files in a certain directory. It invokes pngcrush to decrease the file size of all PNG files in a given directory.
* git-author-lines.sh - A utility script to get the number of lines changed by a given author in a git repository
* sql-dump-extract-db.txt - A utility script to extract the SQL statements for one database from an SQL dump of multiple databases

Special purpose script:

* update.sh   - That is the update script that can be used to (you guessed it) update any of the above scripts by downloading the latest version of it. If you want to update foo.sh, just invoke

      ./update.sh foo.sh

  Purely optional, you won't need it very often, but it might come in useful.
